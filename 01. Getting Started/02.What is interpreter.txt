An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions written using one of the many high-level programming languages. 
The interpreter transforms the high-level program into an intermediate language that it then executes, 
or it could parse the high-level source code and then performs the commands directly, which is done line by line or statement by statement.
